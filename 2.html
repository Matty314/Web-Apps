	Sir Clive Marles Sinclair founded Sinclair radionics in 1961. His first major invention was the Sinclair Executive in 1972, this was the 
	first 'slim-line' electric pocket calculator weighing at 71g and measuring at 137.2mm × 55.9mm × 8.9mm. This small size was achievable by 
	pulsing the current of the TMS1802, this reduced the power consumption by a factor greater than 10.
	<br><br>  
	He is also responsible for the production of the ZX80. The ZX80 was the first computer in the UK to be produced on the mass market of home computers with a cost of less than £100.
	The ZX80 ended up shipping 100,000 units and at one point the waiting lists were back for months.
	Alongside Sinclair Research the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum were later developed.
	The ZX81 was a huge success selling 1.5 million units in not just the UK but also in the US under a liscensed company, Timex. The way the ZX81 was
	able to remain so cheap was by using minmal components e.g not having its own personal monitor.
	The ZX Spectrum was an even greater success than its predecessor selling a major amount of 5 million units.
	<br><br> 
	The TV80 also known as the "Flat Screen Pocket TV" was also produced by Sincliar research on 1983, however unlike Sinclair's
	other inventions the TV80 was a failure.
