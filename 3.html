	Sir Clive Marles Sinclairs technological contribution is relevant today as he is the one responsible for the production of the first low-cosr
	slim line pocket calculator, the sinclair cambridge. This allowed for a much more affordable cost for many people which would have 
	vastly helped mathematical based work(architects, builders, stuudents etc.).
	<br><br>
	The introduction of the ZX80, ZX81, ZX spectrum is also relevant today as it was the first affordable home computer (under Â£100)
	to be brought to the market. The ZX81 and ZX Spectrum managed to sell more than 1.5 million units and 5 million units respectively.
	The release of these home computers helped show the high demand for home computers and is what helped revolutionize the wave of home 
	computers which is what many people rely on in their daily lives today. After the release of ZX81 it was said to be the point where
	computing was an activity for the public rather than just businessmen.
	<br><br>
	Also The limitations of the ZX81 which were due to keeping the low cost of the machine is what caused other people to try to improve upon
	the system later on down the line. This lead to the release of third parter devices, such as printers and ram packs etc. About 200 independant 
	companies were created to distribute hardware which was compatible to ht e ZX81. Without the entrance of the ZX81 there would be less development
	in these devices.
	<br><br>
	The ZX Spectrum was one of the first popular home computers, The release lead to software and hardware companies booming both on release and even now.
	The boom in software and hardware means that even better advances can be made in these fields which in turn provides a better quality for both.
